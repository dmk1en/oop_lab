3. In Java, when you pass an object as a parameter to a method, you're passing the reference to the object, not the actual object itself. This means that changes made to the object's state within the method will affect the original object outside the method and this explain why after the changeTitle method the title is changed. However, if you reassign the reference within the method, it won't affect the original reference outside the method and this explain why after the swap method the title of these two object still remain.
