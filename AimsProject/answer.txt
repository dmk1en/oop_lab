Q: What class should implement the Comparable interface?
A: A class should implement the Comparable interface when instances of the class need to be sorted or compared. 

Q: In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
A: We can use compareTo() method for the attributes one by one in a order that we want

Q: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?
A: You cann't directly achieve this because Comparable defines a single natural ordering for objects. 

Q: Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing
length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
A: In compareTo() method, first I would check the type of Media object, whether it is DVD or not, and if true, I would compare them by the attributes that I wanted.
